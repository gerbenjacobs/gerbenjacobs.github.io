<p>
    When we bought our house in 2015 we got all the regular communication appliances; TVs + cable, landlines, internet,
    etc.<br>
    But we soon realized that we prefer to be on our computers more and as such the TV was left unused, most of the
    time.

<p>
    Recently I realized that I'm really using YouTube as if it was my cable TV. I could also clear see the type of
    content that I'm watching, and it made me think that I've actually built my own TV channel.
</p>

<p>In order to share some gems I wanted to write this blogpost.</p>

<p>
    <strong>Marques Brownlee</strong> has been at the game for quite a while, he does a bunch of hardware tech reviews
    and has recently even ventured into car reviews, mostly EVs.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Undecided with Matt Ferrell</strong> is a channel about <em>undecided</em> technologies, solutions etc.
    Matt is always coming with new information from the STEM field and I find this quite interesting.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Joe Scott</strong> has more of a science channel, but does quite a broad range of topics. His work is
    always quite researched, and he has a very calm and soothing voice.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Wendover Productions</strong> is a channel about aviation and transportation, at heart. However, he also
    does a lot of other interesting topics, like China's energy grid, Angola's richest city or NYCs water supply.

    Honorable mentions: Andrew Rousso, Lennar Young, Drew Lynch, Elanor Morton, Chris Turner, CalebCity, Fairbairn Films.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Vlog Creations</strong> is practical comedy in Florida. So that's absurdity on top of absurdity.
    Motorized porta-potties, family van with hydraulics, dressing up as a spider and calling pest control.
    All with a good heart, which must be said!
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Sammy O'Beid</strong> is a Palestian-American comedian. He used to be a math teacher, so there's
    quite a few math-related jokes involved. Obviously doesn't shy away from making fun/drawing attention
    to his heritage.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Chocolate Sundaes</strong> is a predominantly black and people of color comedy channel.
    They're part of the Laugh Factory company. Some comedians feel like they're not even doing a bit,
    they're just sharing stories and they're funny as hell.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Trevor Wallace</strong> is a stand-up comedian, although also quite a YouTube personality.
    He's very good at "fuck boi", "crypto bro", "Subaru driver" and similar stereotypes. Somehow he
    always makes it look so natural and if you watch his performance videos also, clearly good at crowd-work.

<p>
    <strong>LevelCapGaming</strong> is a big name in the First-Person-Shooter (FPS) community.
    He's been documenting the Battlefield franchise since I can remember. He's also doing
    news updates from time to time, very useful for someone who doesn't play many FPSs anymore.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Quill18</strong> is a Canadian YouTuber who's big into 4X, but also space games and colony builders.
    He used to be a programmer and has a second channel where he does programming tutorials for games, as well
    as videos of him attending Game Jams such as Ludum Dare.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>KatherineOfSky</strong> is big into productivity and management games. She's also a big fan of
    anything cute. Her biggest series is Factorio. I consider her the Queen of Blueprints.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>SplatterCatGaming</strong> does all the indies games that come out. He's perfected it to a tee,
    and within a 30-minute video you can get a good overview of what's in the game. There's a lot of research
    and playing that's required.
