<p>
    When we bought our house in 2015 we got all the regular communication appliances;
    TVs + cable, landlines, internet, etc.<br>
    But we soon realized that we prefer to be on our computers more and as such the TV was left unused,
    most of the time.
</p>

<p>
    Recently I realized that I'm really using YouTube as if it was my cable TV. I could also clear see the type of
    content that I'm watching, and it made me think that I've actually built my own TV channel.
</p>

<p>In order to share some gems I wanted to write this blogpost.</p>

<p>
    <strong>Marques Brownlee</strong> has been at the game for quite a while, he does a bunch of hardware tech reviews
    and has recently even ventured into car reviews, mostly EVs.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Undecided with Matt Ferrell</strong> is a channel about <em>undecided</em> technologies, solutions etc.
    Matt is always coming with new information from the STEM field and I find this quite interesting.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Joe Scott</strong> has more of a science channel, but does quite a broad range of topics. His work is
    always quite researched, and he has a very calm and soothing voice.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Wendover Productions</strong> is a channel about aviation and transportation, at heart. However, he also
    does a lot of other interesting topics, like China's energy grid, Angola's richest city or NYCs water supply.

<p>
    Honorable mentions: Andrew Rousso, Lennar Young, Drew Lynch, Elanor Morton, Chris Turner, CalebCity, Fairbairn
    Films.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Vlog Creations</strong> is practical comedy in Florida. So that's absurdity on top of absurdity.
    Motorized porta-potties, family van with hydraulics, dressing up as a spider and calling pest control.
    All with a good heart, which must be said!
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Sammy O'Beid</strong> is a Palestinian-American comedian. He used to be a math teacher, so there's
    quite a few math-related jokes involved. Obviously doesn't shy away from making fun/drawing attention
    to his heritage.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Chocolate Sundaes</strong> is a predominantly black and people of color comedy channel.
    They're part of the Laugh Factory company. Some comedians feel like they're not even doing a bit,
    but just sharing stories and being funny as hell.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Trevor Wallace</strong> is a stand-up comedian, although also quite a YouTube personality.
    He's very good at "fuck boi", "crypto bro", "Subaru driver" and similar stereotypes. Somehow he
    always makes it look so natural and if you watch his performance videos also, clearly good at crowd-work.

</div>

<p>
    <strong>LevelCapGaming</strong> is a big name in the First-Person-Shooter (FPS) community.
    He's been documenting the Battlefield franchise since I can remember. He's also doing
    news updates from time to time, very useful for someone who doesn't play many FPSs anymore.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Quill18</strong> is a Canadian YouTuber who's big into 4X, but also space games and colony builders.
    He used to be a programmer and has a second channel where he does programming tutorials for games, as well
    as videos of him attending Game Jams such as Ludum Dare.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>KatherineOfSky</strong> is big into productivity and management games. She's also a big fan of
    anything cute. Her biggest series is Factorio. I consider her the Queen of Blueprints.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>SplatterCatGaming</strong> does all the indies games that come out. He's perfected it to a tee,
    and within a 30-minute video you can get a good overview of what's in the game. There's a lot of research
    and playing that's required.

    </div>
</div>

<p>
    <strong>Absolute History</strong> is like the Discovery Channel from my youth. It's honest and good quality history.
    It's part of the <em>History Hit</em> network, which has several other channels, all worth a watch.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>CrowsEyeProductions</strong> recreates fashion and hairstyles from the past. It's a very interesting
    channel, but they only release content once a month.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Townsends</strong> is a channel about exploring the 18th century lifestyle in the United States. They do
    this by actually living it. Building log cabins, dugout canoes, cooking old recipes.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Time Team Classics</strong> is a channel about the British TV show <em>Time Team</em>. It's a show about
    archaeology, and they're digging up old sites. It's a very interesting show, and the channel has a lot of
    behind-the-scenes footage.

</div>

<p>
    <strong>Dreambound</strong> has been my favourite music channel for quite a while. They promote artists in the
    <em>melodic hardcore</em> genre and that's my jam.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Spaceuntravel</strong> promotes up-and-coming alternative rock and metal bands. Sometimes they have some
    duds, but often time they don't, and you'll find some great new music.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>ＴＲＡＳＨ 新 ドラゴン</strong> creates music videos for <em>dark trap</em> and <em>trap metal</em> songs.
    It's as if someone is vetting soundcloud rappers and letting the good stuff through.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Ghost Killer Entertainment</strong> promotes independent <em>post-hardcore</em> and <em>metalcore</em>
    bands. Most bands even have nice looking music videos.
</p>

    They traveled the US, then Europe in a small campervan and recently bought a bigger van.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Kinging-It</strong> are Craig and Aimee from Wales. They're travellers and have a giant 80s Mercedes van.
    They do a bunch of travel content as well.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Kombilife</strong> is Ben from Jersey along with his dog Alaska. Over the years he's had some short-term
    passengers too. He's driven an old VW van through South America.
</p>

<h3 id="paranormal">Paranormal</h3>

<p>
    After initially watching Buzzfeed Unsolved, I got hooked on paranormal content.
    I decided to start actively looking for channels and found a few that I liked.
    <br>Eventually I ended up on 'medium YouTube' and those are now also part of my diet.
    <br><em>Honorable mentions:</em> Exploring With Josh, TCS Everyday Psychics, Sam And Colby.

<p>
    <strong>Twin Paranormal</strong> is a group of guys, spearheaded by a set of twins, that go to haunted locations.
    They've got this alternative style going on (black, piercings, tattoos) and are very kind,
    a trademark of their channel.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Mackie & Amanda</strong> are two Californian girls, one of them a medium and the other clairaudient.
    It's very interesting to see a ghost hunting channel where at least one person is a medium.
    Not always accurate, but with a good heart.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Paranormal Quest</strong> a two man team that has been doing this for a long time.
    They've become a bit tainted by all the things they've already witnessed, but they're still
    a very good team and show a lot of interesting aspects.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Meta PsycKicks</strong> are two mediums. They introduced me to a lot of concepts.
    In fact, they still do and it takes some mental fortitude for certain videos, like
    "are mermaids real" and "my house speaks to me".

</div>

<p>
    Don't actually follow that many geography channels, but since it makes a lot of sense as a TV channel,
    figured I'd find a few that might match that description.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Atlas Pro</strong> is a documentary-style channel that does a bunch of geography related topics.
    But also geology, ecology and "whatever is needed to explain the subject".
</p>

<p>
    <strong>GeoWizard</strong> is a personal channel consisting of 50% playing Geoguessr and 50% doing adventures.
    A big series is the "x in a straight line", where he tries to walk a country in a GPS-coordinated straight line.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Jay Foreman</strong> adds a bunch of comedy to documentary-style vlogs. A lot of concepts are located to
    London, or England in general, but there's always a hint of geography or topography involved.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Caspian Report</strong> does documentaries on a bunch of topics, but mostly located near the Caspian Sea.
    Since the invasion of Ukraine, there's been an increase in Ukraine/Russia related content.

<p>
    <strong>Stefan Milo</strong> is an archeology and anthropology channel. He's created quite a few
    nice documentaries about our species and the world we live in, and how this all came to be.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>The Budget Museum</strong> is a paleontologist channel. They've created videos about extinct creatures,
    but also endangered, misunderstood and strange animals.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Yes Theory</strong> is a group of friends that travels a lot and does social experiments, in a sense.
    Travelling to war-torn Syria, cooking for strangers, staying in complete darkness for several hours.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Kirsten Dirksen</strong> makes videos about sustainable and minimalistic living. She finds and
    shares a lot of 'tiny houses'. But also talks about different styles of building houses, such as earth ships and
    mud houses.
</p>
