In november 2022 I left Twitter for Mastodon and I've been posting a bit there.

However, between work and parenting, I've noticed I didn't have much time and most of all,
I was getting imposter syndrome. I felt like I had to perform 'to be interesting'.

## So I kinda stopped posting and interacting..

The same imposter feeling I got for my blog and website. However recently I've come around
to that regarding the blog. I realised I'm mostly writing for myself; 'cause it sure is 
interesting to read old blog posts from years ago. And as such, this actual blog post
is an attempt to kickstart everything again.

With regards to social media; I do miss old Twitter..  But I fear that will never come back.

My go to spots right now are just Reddit and Instagram reels, when I'm bored.

## Duality of being chronically online

I used to think I wanted to be a famous open source contributor or a known creator
in the developer community. Which requires me to have an _online presence_.

Becoming a parent however gives you the clich√© but accurate "nothing more important
than your children" adage. This in combination with 'climbing the ladder' and getting
more senior roles also slows this ambition.

Part of me just wants to do my work and live my life. But part of me also thinks;
"you know what, I could see myself giving presentations at conferences".

__But for now..__

I guess, I'll still be a developer. I have no interest in opening an artisanal sourdough bakery.. yet.
