    I was working on a Laravel project and had to work with a <a title="Eloquent ORM docs" href="https://laravel.com/docs/database/eloquent" >Eloquent ORM</a> object;
    I then needed to create an empty stdClass object.
</p>

<p>
    There's a chance that a person is not known and being lazy I wanted to fill the form anyway with my Person object, so I needed a mockup of that object.
</p>

{{< highlight php >}}
<?php
$person = (object) array_fill_keys(
    array('firstname', 'lastname', 'email', 'photo'),
    ''
);
?>
{{< /highlight >}}

<p>
    I'd say <a href="https://gist.github.com/gerbenjacobs/5525165" title="Create an empty stdClass object Gist" >this solution</a> is quick and dirty.. but frankly,
    it's not that dirty at all!
</p>

<p>
    In short, this one-liner, creates an array with the 4 keys provided and gives them an empty value (<code>''</code>) then we just typecast it into an object. Done!
