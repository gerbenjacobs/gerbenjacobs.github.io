<h1>Now</h1>

<p>
    <small>
        This page explains what my life currently looks like.
        See <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">nownownow.com</a> to learn about the concept.

<h3>Work ü¶Å</h3>

<p>
    Currently, I'm a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> at <span style="color: #FE6200;">ING Netherlands</span>.
    I work in the MDPL team that's responsible for tracing, metrics and logs; also known as observability (o11y).
</p>

<p>
    Specifically working on a marketplace of metrics, where teams can expose certain metrics in a defined format,
    for other teams to use.
</p>

<p>
    We use Grafana (with Mimir), OpenTelemetry and Prometheus and Go as the language.
    We have built custom controllers to synchronize our agents, one of which is a custom one for Prometheus Recording
    Rules.
</p>

<h3>Life üçÇ</h3>

<p>
    Partly wondering where the summer went, but also happy for autumn to be here.
    It's probably my favourite season.
</p>

<p>
    Kids are growing fast, a two-year old who's getting so much better at speaking
    and a seven-year old who's storing the most random knowledge.
    Did you know <i>time moves slower</i> near a black hole? <small>(I haven't verified it)</small>
</p>

<p>
    As a natural extension of my <a href="/social-media-detox/">Social Media Detox</a> blogpost, I started
    posting more blogs, one about the course that I'm organizing for an unofficial team event,
    and since I've posted about my <a href="/svc-an-opinionated-go-service-framework/">svc framework</a>,
    I figured I'd also introduce the <a href="/fin-trading212-aggregator-tool/">fin tool</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Having to create the <a href="/using-unix-pipes-with-go/">Using Unix pipes with Go</a> course
    <i>sparked a lot of joy</i> and has caused me to write more.
</p>

<h3>Indie Web ü§ó</h3>

<p>
    I'm not even sure how I stumbled upon it, but I found out that are still <strong>webrings</strong> out there.
    This let me down the rabbit hole of the indie web, the revival (or was it never dead?) of
    <strong>neocities.org</strong>,
    the concept of a <strong>/now</strong> page and again reminded myself of <strong>humans.txt</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    So clearly I added those last two endpoints. ü§©
</p>
