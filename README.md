# gerbenjacobs.github.io: my personal blog

This is my personal blog, available at https://blog.gerbenjacobs.nl


This site is using Hugo (a static site generator) and a theme I created myself called Bootspoon.
It's based on Bootstrap v5 and uses some fonts from Google, namely 'Nunito' and 'Permanent Marker'.
