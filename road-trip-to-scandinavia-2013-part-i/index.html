(Great-Britain, Germany, Belgium, France, Spain, Austria) but never to one of the nordic ones.</p><p>At a previous internship 2 co-workers of mine have been there and they were absolutely loving it, especially Norway.
If you asked me in february where I'd go, I would have probably said the Garda lake in Italy. But since June all plans had changed to Norway.</p><figure class=figure><img loading=lazy class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" src=https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5535/9390761123_2b51487e01_b.jpg alt="Riksvei 55 towards Lom"><figcaption class=figure-caption>Riksvei 55 towards Lom</figcaption></figure><h2>Summary</h2><dl class=dl-horizontal><dt>Total days</dt><dd>Thirteen, driving into the night, arriving on sunday, exactly 2 weeks later.</dd><dt>Driven</dt><dd>4.298 kms (2.671 miles)</dd><dt>Photographs</dt><dd>1.242 (Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ38) & 292 (Samsung Galaxy S2 (phone))</dd><dt># of currencies</dt><dd>Four (Euro, Danish krone, Norwegian krone, Swedish krona)</dd><dt># of timezones</dt><dd>Just one (Central European Time)</dd><dt>Weather</dt><dd>Rain in Stavanger on day 5, overcast on 6, light rain on day 13 and heavy rain on day 14, except when we were in Malm√∂,

This would be on Wednesday, July 17th. Apart from that, nothing was set and it would be <strong>an adventure</strong>.</p><blockquote class=blockquote>We often reminded ourselves of that as well "hey.. it's an adventure. Anything can happen!".</blockquote><p>Of course we had plotted some stuff (and with <em>we</em> I mostly mean my girlfriend).
We first decided on the base route: Arnhem (starting point), S√∏nderborg, Herning (via Silkeborg), L√∏kken and then Hirtshals to leave for Norway.
There we would leave Kristiansand and stay in Mandal, followed by Stavanger, Bergen, Lom, via the Geirangerfjord and Trollstigen
to Lillehammer, Oslo, G√∂teborg, Copenhagen and via Ribe back home. My navigator and co-pilot also wrote down a lot of interesting stuff,
which is why we'll know a lot of the times of arrival/departure and prices of ferries.</p><h2 id=day1>Day 1: Arnhem (NL) to S√∏nderborg (DK)</h2><figure class=figure><a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/theonewithout/9386926903/in/set-72157634832499277/><img loading=lazy class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" src=https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3798/9386926903_d99735dc0d_b.jpg alt="Driving into Denmark"></a><figcaption class=figure-caption>Driving into Denmark</figcaption></figure><p>We left at 8:22 for S√∏nderborg, a Danish coastal city in the southern part of Denmark. It would be 590 kilometers.
We cruised through Germany, wish I had a BWM, but my 1.6 engine did fine with 130km/h. We arrived in the afternoon in the city,
parked in some street and went for a little walk around the town. The main objective was to find an ATM so we had some Danish kroner.
We had planned to go to the castle, but it looked less impressive and we are cheap-asses, so we just walked around it, the beach to the left
and the harbour to the right. Then we walked over the short boulevard and stumbled into the city center. Quite by luck we found an ATM.</p><div class=row><div class=col-md-6><figure class=figure><a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/theonewithout/9386926821/in/set-72157634832499277/><img loading=lazy class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" src=https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2894/9386926821_75df700b60_z.jpg alt="Entering Denmark"></a><figcaption class=figure-caption>Entering Denmark</figcaption></figure></div><div class=col-md-6><figure class=figure><a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/theonewithout/9386926071/in/set-72157634832499277/><img loading=lazy class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" src=https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3834/9386926071_6b482137e9_z.jpg alt="Danish flags in S√∏nderborg"></a><figcaption class=figure-caption>Danish flags in S√∏nderborg</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>Then we went to the camping, it was 16:00 by then. The Danish campsites were the most expensive and
at this first one we also had to buy some sort of "Europe Camping Key" card.
Which would be send by mail to my home address and would expire in one year. Pretty useless for the two campsites we visited in Denmark.
None of the other campsites requested to see this "Europe" card.</p><p>We got to pick a spot somewhere on a field. This camping was mainly focused on caravans and campers.
We found a spot next to the tennis court, between some trees. This was probably not supposed to be a tent spot,
maybe a camperspot, but it was somewhat private from the rest of the field.</p><p>Had to fight to get the tent pegs into the hard ground, probably through some oak tree roots, but it worked.
We didn't bother with the wind guy lines, because we were already pretty sheltered. After eating some tortellinis with spicy tomato sauce,
made on our trangia (wonderful things) we went for a walk.</p><div class=row><div class=col-md-6><figure class=figure><a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/theonewithout/9386925643/in/set-72157634832499277/><img loading=lazy class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" src=https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3767/9386925643_c8b2a430ea_z.jpg alt="Quaint little street in S√∏nderborg"></a><figcaption class=figure-caption>Quaint little street in S√∏nderborg</figcaption></figure></div><div class=col-md-6><figure class=figure><a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/theonewithout/9389695650/in/set-72157634832499277/><img loading=lazy class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" src=https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5513/9389695650_eac9cdff99_z.jpg alt="S√∏nderborg harbour and boulevard"></a><figcaption class=figure-caption>S√∏nderborg harbour and boulevard</figcaption></figure></div></div><div class=row><div class=col-md-6><figure class=figure><a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/theonewithout/9389696000/in/set-72157634832499277/><img loading=lazy class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" src=https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7358/9389696000_fa67a5328c_z.jpg alt="Nice house and hotel in one"></a><figcaption class=figure-caption>Nice house and hotel in one</figcaption></figure></div><div class=col-md-6><figure class=figure><a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/theonewithout/9389697152/in/set-72157634832499277/><img loading=lazy class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" src=https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5483/9389697152_0f32011cc7_z.jpg alt="S√∏nderborg slot"></a><figcaption class=figure-caption>S√∏nderborg slot</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>When we were there, it was the second last day of <a title="Ringridning fest" href=http://www.ringriderfest.com/>the Ringridning Festival</a>,

Mm shit, where do we go now? Hey wait a minute.. there's a supermarket over here! So we went into the "Netto" which has a

and bought some tasty things for on the road; blessing in disguise.</p><p>We were heading towards Ry, a little town towards the south-east of Silkeborg, below all the lakes. Here we would get on a boat and
get off at <a title="Wikipedia page of the Himmelbjerget" href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himmelbjerget>the Himmelbjerget</a>,
Denmark's (once believed to be) tallest mountain (read: hill) with its magnificent height of 147 meters.</p><div class=row><div class=col-md-6><figure class=figure><a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/theonewithout/9386919179/in/set-72157634832499277/><img loading=lazy class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" src=https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5464/9386919179_ba8c78ba04_z.jpg alt="Boat in the harbour of Ry"></a><figcaption class=figure-caption>Boat in the harbour of Ry</figcaption></figure></div><div class=col-md-6><figure class=figure><a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/theonewithout/9386920009/in/set-72157634832499277/><img loading=lazy class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" src=https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3738/9386920009_58e544eb39_z.jpg alt="A little motorboat heading for the lakes"></a><figcaption class=figure-caption>A little motorboat heading for the lakes</figcaption></figure></div></div><figure class=figure><a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/theonewithout/9389692766/in/set-72157634832499277/><img loading=lazy class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" src=https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7451/9389692766_40bcf7ca77_b.jpg alt="Looking towards Birks√∏ lake"></a><figcaption class=figure-caption>Looking towards Birks√∏ lake</figcaption></figure><p>We took a boat (not the steam-engine one) to the drop-off point where we met up with our friend and walked this <strong>mount Everest</strong>

We followed him to his house and then realised how far he had
driven to come and see us. We drove on some small roads, which was nice, this was a bit more touristy than driving on the highway,
which is probably what my GPS would have done.</p><p>After the grand tour of his (parents) crib and introducing him to <strong>stroopwafels</strong>, we went to Herning and saw some "culture".
We then went shopping and bought an entire cow, basically.</p><p>After some Danish cuisine we played Call of Duty split screen and my girlfriend and I went to sleep in his living room. This was the only day we didn't sleep in a tent.</p><h4>Read on!</h4><p><a href=https://blog.gerbenjacobs.nl/road-trip-to-scandinavia-2013-part-ii/>Next &#187;</a></p></article><hr class=rainbow><div id=disqus_thread></div><script>window.disqus_config=function(){},function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById("disqus_thread").innerHTML="Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.";return}var t=document,e=t.createElement("script");e.async=!0,e.src="//gerbenjacobs.disqus.com/embed.js",e.setAttribute("data-timestamp",+new Date),(t.head||t.body).appendChild(e)}()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a></div></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-6 col-lg-8 col-md-11"><div class=row><div class=col-md-6><div class=card><img loading=lazy src=https://blog.gerbenjacobs.nl/img/flickr-theonewithout-norway-bench.png class="card-img-top card-img-height" alt="Road trip to Scandinavia 2013 - Part II"><div class=card-body><span class=card-title title="Road trip to Scandinavia 2013 - Part II">Road trip to Scandinavia 2013...</span></div><div class=card-footer><a href=https://blog.gerbenjacobs.nl/road-trip-to-scandinavia-2013-part-ii/ class="btn btn-primary">&#171; Next</a></div></div></div><div class=col-md-6><div class=card><img loading=lazy src=https://blog.gerbenjacobs.nl/img/post-bg-01.jpg class="card-img-top card-img-height" alt="SocialSpace at ESTEC in Noordwijk"><div class=card-body><span class=card-title title="SocialSpace at ESTEC in Noordwijk">SocialSpace at ESTEC in...</span></div><div class="card-footer text-end"><a href=https://blog.gerbenjacobs.nl/socialspace-at-estec-in-noordwijk/ class="btn btn-primary">Previous &#187;</a></div></div></div></div><div class=row><div class=col>Find any post in the <a href=/posts/archive/>archive</a>.</div></div></div></div></div><footer class="footer mt-4 py-3 bg-light rainbow" id=footer><p>Copyright &copy; 2024 Gerben Jacobs</p><a href=/index.xml><span class="badge p-1 footer-social" style=border-color:orange><img src=/img/social/rss.svg alt=RSS>
