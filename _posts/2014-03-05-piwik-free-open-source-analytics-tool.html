    I have been using <a href="http://piwik.org" target="_blank">Piwik</a> for a couple of months and I love it.
</p>

<p>
    I started using it first at my internship at <a href="http://www.leadelephant.com" target="_blank">leadelephant.com</a>,
    not really as an analytics tool, but more as a data collection tool.
</p>

<p>
    The main goal of Piwik is an analytics tool, a direct competitor to Google Analytics. But it's really more than that.
    Like the data collection method I just mentioned, it could also be a community monitoring tool, which is how we use it atÂ

    Piwik is a JavaScript tracking snippet backed by a PHP dashboard and MySQL backend. Installation is really simple and it works out of the box.
    If you're site is having a thousand visitors a day it's a good idea to read through
    <a href="http://piwik.org/docs/installation-optimization/#optimize-secure-piwik" target="_blank">the Optimization docs</a>.
    <br>If you're using Cloudflare, you might want to tweak the config file to start using <code>X-FORWARDED-FOR</code> headers.
    <br>Other than that it's just a quick install and you're done!

    Piwik underwent a big redesign in 2014 and is looking quite good. (It used to look a little dated!)

    I run both Google Analytics and Piwik. I use Piwik daily, to check up on real-time visitors and trends. I use Google Analytics for end-of-the-month kind of actions, looking at the aggregated data. There are a lot of blogposts already comparing GA with Piwik, but as you can see, you don't have to pick one.

<p>
    <strong>You can use both!</strong>
</p>

<p>
    So take 5 minutes out of your day and <a href="http://piwik.org/download/" target="_blank">download and install Piwik</a>.
