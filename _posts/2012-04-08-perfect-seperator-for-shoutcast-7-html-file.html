<p>
    To go along nicely with <a href="{% post_url 2012-04-07-add-ip-address-to-shoutcast-rip %}">my previous Shoutcast tip</a>,
    here is a trick to separate the data in the Shoutcast 7.html for displaying.
</p>

<p>
    If you, like me, use the <em>Shoutcast 7.html trick</em> to get some quick stats about your stream broadcast
    but are getting some inconsistencies with parsing the comma-separated input you get, try this:
</p>

{% highlight php %}<?php $data = preg_split("/[,]+/", $string, 7); ?>{% endhighlight %}

<p>
    A possible outcome would be this:
</p>
{% highlight php %}
<?php
Array (
    [0] => 1
    [1] => 1
    [2] => 1
    [3] => 1000
    [4] => 1
    [5] => 192
    [6] => "Woe, Is Me - Hell, or High Water"
)
?>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
    If you were to <code>explode()</code> this string, you'd get the artist in 2 nodes and with this songtitle you'd get that one in 2 nodes as well.
</p>

<p>
    The <code>preg_split</code> function has the nice ability to add a <code>limit</code> parameter, thus saying "Split this string on commas, but only do it for the first 7"
    and this will guarantee that your artist and song title are stuck together on the last index.
