    I have been noticing a severe drop in spam in my comment queue. I used to have to delete anywhere from 5 to 10
    comments a day in the queue with just Akismet.
    Now there's not <strong>one</strong> comment.. 99.99% of the time.
</p>

<p>
    I didn't really think anything of it until I just realized why this change occurred; I had enabled Cloudflare for my
    blog.

<p>
    <a title="Cloudflare" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> acts as somewhat of a
    firewall and CDN in one, it blocks malicious requests and
    serves cached versions of your blog/site/resources. For this particular blog the stats aren't that overwhelming, but
    for one of my other sites we're talking about multiple gigabytes!
</p>

<p>
    The <a title="Cloudflare plugin for Wordpress" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/cloudflare/">Cloudflare
    plugin for Wordpress</a> doesn't only adjust the incoming IPs (they have to change it to the <code>X-FORWARDED-FOR</code>) but it also will tag
    any comment (and accompanying meta-data) as a spammer in the <abbr title="CloudFlare">CF</abbr> system.
</p>

<p>
    So with my efforts and those of the other thousand of Cloudflare users combined, the spam queue is getting smaller
    and smaller every month. Making Cloudflare a better spam protection than <a href="https://akismet.com">Akismet</a>.
