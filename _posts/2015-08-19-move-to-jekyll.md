So I moved my site to Jekyll and Github Pages.  
The reason was that I wanted to get rid of my hosted VPS solution which I didn't use at all.
I had great plans of making lots of small websites, but that never really planned out.

I also wanted to get rid of the 500ms page loads of Wordpress (yes, I'm sure you can make that better).
All I need for my blog is a static website. I plan to do comments with Disqus.

I looked briefly at other static site generators, but the fact that Jekyll comes free with 
Github (`git push`-ing your entire folder is lovely) and that for your personal site you don't 
require the `gh-pages` branch all made it a relative easy candidate to pick.
