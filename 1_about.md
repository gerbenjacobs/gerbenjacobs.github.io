**Hi!**

I’m a 27-year old (web)developer from The Netherlands. My interests lie with webdevelopment, databases, design patterns, social media, communities, API’s, open data, basically; everything web-related.

More about me, including links to other online services, can be found on my About.me page.

**Blogwise..**  
I write about ‘professional’ things and ‘personal’ matters. Some of my posts are philosophical, which in a sense is personal, but it really spans both categories! So if you only care about one type of blogposts, take a pick. You’re free (and encouraged!) to read everything!
