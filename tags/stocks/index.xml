We&amp;rsquo;re now 5 months further, and that means we&amp;rsquo;ve reached the halfway mark of the buying period. So how&amp;rsquo;s it going?

ROI of 25% or higher Net profit margin of 25% or higher Market cap of 2 billion or higher Positive dividend Average trading volume of 1 million So the important values are the ROI and net profit margins.</description></item></channel></rss>
