      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s time for a mental exercise. You are going to give &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/estimation&#34;&gt;story points&lt;/a&gt; to a user story, that I actually completed.&#xA;Then I’m going to tell you what I had to do and which issues I ran into.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have a page that lists birthdays for people on that day, but excluding the current year. This way we can showcase everyone who is 1 year or older.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is nice, but if you want to find birthdays for a specific date, you might have to wait a year for it to come around.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
