With my new-found intention to start blogging more, I&amp;rsquo;ve been going down rabbit holes. 🐰&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It started with (re-)discovering Neocities and finding &lt;em>cool internet concepts&lt;/em> like a &lt;a href="https://blog.gerbenjacobs.nl/now">/now&lt;/a> page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was 2004 when I first got embroiled in web development, making fan-sites for Habbo Hotel.
Which led to me building communities, which then evolved to tooling and open-source.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was following the trends closely, I was there when microformats and the concept of the indieweb got born.
I however did not fully understand it as a teenager. I was just curious about the concept of data
aggregation with microformats and getting better SEO in Google.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Social Media Detox</title><link>https://blog.gerbenjacobs.nl/social-media-detox/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 23:36:20 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.gerbenjacobs.nl/social-media-detox/</guid><description>&lt;p>In november 2022 I left Twitter for Mastodon and I&amp;rsquo;ve been posting a bit there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, between work and parenting, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much time and most of all,
I was getting imposter syndrome. I felt like I had to perform &amp;rsquo;to be interesting'.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="so-i-kinda-stopped-posting-and-interacting">So I kinda stopped posting and interacting..&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The same imposter feeling I got for my blog and website. However recently I&amp;rsquo;ve come around
to that regarding the blog. I realised I&amp;rsquo;m mostly writing for myself; &amp;lsquo;cause it sure is
interesting to read old blog posts from years ago. And as such, this actual blog post
is an attempt to kickstart everything again.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My ROI stock portfolio experiment; the results</title><link>https://blog.gerbenjacobs.nl/my-roi-stock-portfolio-experiment-the-results/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2023 10:59:15 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.gerbenjacobs.nl/my-roi-stock-portfolio-experiment-the-results/</guid><description>&lt;p>
 A year has passed since my
 &lt;a href="https://blog.gerbenjacobs.nl/my-roi-stock-portfolio-experiment/">first post about my ROI stock portfolio&lt;/a>
 and that means it is time to see how it went.
&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="portfolio">The portfolio&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>
 As of 10th of August 2023, using USD-based percentages, the portfolio looks like this:
&lt;/p>

&lt;table>

 &lt;td>❌️️(-12.60%)&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>

&lt;p>
 In US Dollars this is a &lt;strong>14.4%&lt;/strong> return, which is not bad at all.
 Foreign exchange rates however gave me a &lt;strong>-5%&lt;/strong> if I were to convert it to Euros straight away.

what my plan was. We&amp;rsquo;re now 5 months further, and that means we&amp;rsquo;ve reached the halfway mark of the buying period.
So how&amp;rsquo;s it going?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-portfolio">The portfolio&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As of 10th of January 2023, just before I deposited another €100, the portfolio looked like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>❌(-3.40%) Microsoft (MSFT) - ❌(-14.07%)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>❌(-2.20%) Apple (AAPL) - ❌(-17.41%)&lt;/li>

&lt;li>✔️(+0.55%) Crescent Point Energy (CPG) - ❌(-10.19%)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Volatile, that&amp;rsquo;s how it&amp;rsquo;s going. Just like the rest of the 2022 market. In fact, now with a couple of months
of hindsight we can also see that my starting point, August 2022, was one of the &amp;lsquo;worst&amp;rsquo; months to start.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>YouTube is my TV</title><link>https://blog.gerbenjacobs.nl/youtube-is-my-tv/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2022 23:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.gerbenjacobs.nl/youtube-is-my-tv/</guid><description>&lt;p>
 When we bought our house in 2015 we got all the regular communication appliances;
 TVs and cable subscriptions, landlines, internet, etc.&lt;br>
 But we soon realized that we prefer to be on our computers more and as such the TV was left unused,
 most of the time.
&lt;/p>

&lt;p>
 Recently I realized that I'm really using YouTube as if it was my cable TV. I could also clearly see the type of
 content that I'm watching, and it made me think that I've actually built my &lt;strong>own TV channel&lt;/strong>.
&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My ROI stock portfolio experiment</title><link>https://blog.gerbenjacobs.nl/my-roi-stock-portfolio-experiment/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.gerbenjacobs.nl/my-roi-stock-portfolio-experiment/</guid><description>&lt;p>After reading a bit about multiple well-known investors mentioning how important Return On Invested Capital is,
I decided to generate a small portfolio (actually a pie within &lt;a href="https://www.trading212.com/invite/HrAs2dFZ">Trading212&lt;/a>) with some metrics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I used &lt;a href="https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&amp;amp;f=cap_midover,fa_div_pos,fa_netmargin_o25,fa_roi_verypos,sh_avgvol_o1000&amp;amp;ft=4">finviz&lt;/a> to screen and since they don&amp;rsquo;t have ROIC, I used Return On Investment (ROI).
This is a different metric but is the closest option there is. My screening options were as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>ROI of 25% or higher&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Net profit margin of 25% or higher&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Market cap of 2 billion or higher&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Positive dividend&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Average trading volume of 1 million&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So the important values are the ROI and net profit margins. However to give me some more established companies
I also made sure that they have a market cap of 2 billion or more, enough trading volume and a positive dividend.
This last option as a soft guarantee that the company is free cash flow positive.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First month at GitHub</title><link>https://blog.gerbenjacobs.nl/first-month-at-github/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.gerbenjacobs.nl/first-month-at-github/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been a month since I joined GitHub in February of 2022.
I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying myself a lot, but I&amp;rsquo;m also not sure if the reality has set in completely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2014 I started my first tech job and remember that I went to a conference and got GitHub stickers,
they were awesome and all ended up on my MacBook. Eight years later I now work at that exact company. 🚀&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="onboard-sessions">Onboard sessions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The first two weeks are oriented towards onboard sessions, unfortunately they were in Pacific
standard time, so that meant 8PM CET. The first thing that you&amp;rsquo;ll notice is that a lot of the work
you do is by using GitHub itself. There&amp;rsquo;s an &lt;code>onboarding&lt;/code> repository with a project for every
person that joined during your cohort. Here you can find &lt;strong>issues&lt;/strong> with tasks that you can complete
during the first days.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dutch Open Hackathon</title><link>https://blog.gerbenjacobs.nl/dutch-open-hackathon/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2014 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.gerbenjacobs.nl/dutch-open-hackathon/</guid><description>&lt;p>
 Last weekend I attended the &lt;a title="Dutch Open Hackathon" href="https://www.dutchopenhackathon.com/">Dutch Open Hackathon&lt;/a>
 in the UP building (previously known as IJ-toren) in Amsterdam.
 &lt;br>I went there as part of team 'Pi Ducks'. The team consisted of some colleagues from
 &lt;a title="bol.com" href="https://www.bol.com" >bol.com&lt;/a> (where I started working in July) and a front-end designer we met through Twitter.
 We had a pretty broad range of skills in one team!

&lt;p>
 Preikestolen is one of Norway's famous tourist&lt;s>traps&lt;/s>locations, it's a hiking trail that ends at the Preikestolen (Pulpit/Preacher's Chair),
 a slab of rock hanging over the Lysefjord fjord. There's also the Trolltunga (Devil's Tongue) east of Bergen, which is similar just a lot smaller.
 But we didn't go there.
&lt;/p>

&lt;figure class="figure ">
 &lt;a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/theonewithout/9389967701/>
 &lt;img loading="lazy" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" src=https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2879/9389967701_37f445fe71_b.jpg alt=Preikestolen>
 &lt;/a>

 &lt;figcaption class="figure-caption">Preikestolen&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>

&lt;p>
 We had planned the entire day for our trip to the Preikestolen. It had been advertised as a serious achievement, and we weren't that familiar with such hikes.
 With a mix of GPS navigation and following the signs, we took the "backdoor road" Fv316 (instead of the main road Rv13).
 This led us through windy hills, small roads and sheep on either side. A far better idea than the highway.
 Both roads end up in the village of Lauvvik were we took the ferry to Oanes, a 10-minute trip.
 After the ferry ramp you make a sharp turn and go through a tunnel to the other side of the mountain.
 After a short while you leave the main road again and take a smaller "mountain road".
 Here we ended up in a tiny traffic jam; this meant it was the right location.

&lt;p>
 The next day we drove to the seaside town of Løkken, famous for its candy store and beaches.
 We arrived early in the afternoon and parked at a big parking lot, for beachgoers. First up; the beach of course.
&lt;/p>

 This beach is also famous for its World War II bunkers part of the
 &lt;a title="Wikipedia page for Atlantic Wall" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Wall" >Atlantic Wall&lt;/a> and we
 could see them in the distance. But first a little walk on the beach and visiting the pier, where the water was frantically splashing over.
 Something I wanted to get on camera &amp;mdash; would have been better if I had cleaned the salt seawater afterwards.

&lt;p>
 I've been wanting to visit Scandinavia for quite a while, I've been to many European countries
 (Great-Britain, Germany, Belgium, France, Spain, Austria) but never to one of the nordic ones.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
 At a previous internship 2 co-workers of mine have been there and they were absolutely loving it, especially Norway.
 If you asked me in february where I'd go, I would have probably said the Garda lake in Italy. But since June all plans had changed to Norway.

&lt;p>
 Yesterday I went to the open day at ESTEC (European Space Research and Technology Centre) in Noordwijk, the Netherlands.
 This is the ESA (European Space Agency) facility that houses most of the technology research and project development.
 I'm not even sure what it was anymore, but they have some rooms and utilties over there that even make NASA jealous!
&lt;/p>

&lt;p>
 However.. I wasn't just at the open day, I was actually invited for the
 &lt;a title="#SocialSpace on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=%23socialspace&amp;src=typd" >#SocialSpace&lt;/a> event hosted by

 &lt;a title="SocialSpace tweeps from ESTEC" href="https://twitter.com/social4space/socialspace-estec-2/members" >these tweeps&lt;/a>.
 Mostly Dutch people, but also some from Belgium, Germany, France and even Spain.
