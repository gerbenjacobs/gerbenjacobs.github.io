There's also the Trolltunga (Devil's Tongue) east of Bergen, which is similar just a lot smaller. But we didn't go there. Preikestolen We had planned the entire day for our trip to the Preikestolen. It had been advertised as a serious achievement, and we weren't that familiar with such hikes.</description></item><item><title>Road trip to Scandinavia 2013 - Part II</title><link>https://blog.gerbenjacobs.nl/road-trip-to-scandinavia-2013-part-ii/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2013 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.gerbenjacobs.nl/road-trip-to-scandinavia-2013-part-ii/</guid><description>Day 3: Løkken and Hjørring The next day we drove to the seaside town of Løkken, famous for its candy store and beaches.

At a previous internship 2 co-workers of mine have been there and they were absolutely loving it, especially Norway. If you asked me in february where I'd go, I would have probably said the Garda lake in Italy.</description></item></channel></rss>
