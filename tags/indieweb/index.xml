With my new-found intention to start blogging more, I&amp;rsquo;ve been going down rabbit holes. 🐰&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It started with (re-)discovering Neocities and finding &lt;em>cool internet concepts&lt;/em> like a &lt;a href="https://blog.gerbenjacobs.nl/now">/now&lt;/a> page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was 2004 when I first got embroiled in web development, making fan-sites for Habbo Hotel.
Which led to me building communities, which then evolved to tooling and open-source.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was following the trends closely, I was there when microformats and the concept of the indieweb got born.
I however did not fully understand it as a teenager. I was just curious about the concept of data
aggregation with microformats and getting better SEO in Google.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
