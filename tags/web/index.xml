 I'm amazed at how often I still "discover" a new HTML5 element. I say discover because really they're all written down in specs. But then again, who reads specs for their enjoyment?
&lt;/p>

&lt;p>
 Today I discovered the meter-element &lt;small>(by first discovering the progress-element)&lt;/small>. They're essentially the same, except that &lt;code>&amp;lt;meter&amp;gt;&lt;/code> also adds
 some sugary deliciousness in the form of colouring. It's here that you should note that IE10 (and higher) only support &amp;lt;progress&amp;gt; at the moment and not &amp;lt;meter&amp;gt;.
 So while both elements are rendered pretty much the same by &lt;span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted;" title="REAL browsers ;)">browsers&lt;/span>,
 it's the semantic meaning that you have to pick.
