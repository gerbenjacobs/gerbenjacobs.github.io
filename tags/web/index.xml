I say discover because really they're all written down in specs. But then again, who reads specs for their enjoyment? Today I discovered the meter-element (by first discovering the progress-element). They're essentially the same, except that &amp;lt;meter&amp;gt; also adds some sugary deliciousness in the form of colouring. It's here that you should note that IE10 (and higher) only support &amp;lt;progress&amp;gt; at the moment and not &amp;lt;meter&amp;gt;.</description></item></channel></rss>
